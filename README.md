# ISYS-4453-DAO
I was instructed to create a DAO for the my Introduction to Blockchain Applications class (ISYS 4453) at the University of Arkansas Center of Blockchain Excellence that would allow my class and future class sections to vote on class proposals covering topics such as covered material, class times, assignments, etc.

## Overview:
- A member's voting power is determined by the amount of voting tokens that they own, divided by the total supply. E.g. a user owns 1 out of the 10 voting tokens minted, so their voting power is 10%.
- Governance deployment using OpenZeppelin ERC20 voting token and Governor contracts (Compiled in Remix IDE)
- Interface integration using Tally.xyz
